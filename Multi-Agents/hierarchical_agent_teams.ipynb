North America is home to several species of sturgeon, each with distinct behaviors and habitats. They are often characterized by their anadromous nature, migrating up rivers to spawn, although some species may spend their entire lives in freshwater.\\n\\n### Sturgeon Species in North America\\n\\n1. **Pallid Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus)**\\n2. **White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)**\\n3. **Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)**\\n4. **Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)**\\n5. **Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus)**\\n\\n### Physical Characteristics\\n- **Scutes**: Sturgeons have several lengthwise rows of bony plates called scutes.\\n- **Tail**: They possess a heterocercal tail, resembling that of sharks.\\n\\n### Behavior and Diet\\nSturgeons typically feed on insects, crustaceans, and fish, often found at the bottom of their habitats. Their migratory patterns vary, with some species being anadromous, traveling from the sea to freshwater to spawn, while others remain in freshwater environments.\\n\\n### Conservation Status\\nSome species of North American sturgeon are facing significant threats due to habitat loss, overfishing, and pollution. Efforts are being made to protect these species, including potential listings under the Endangered Species Act. For instance, a determination is set to be made by 2024 regarding the protection of the lake sturgeon.\\n\\n### Chart: North American Sturgeon Species\\n\\n| Species                   | Characteristics                                              | Habitat                        | Conservation Status  |\\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|\\n| Pallid Sturgeon           | Bony scutes, heterocercal tail                               | Freshwater rivers               | Endangered           |\\n| White Sturgeon            | Largest freshwater fish in North America                     | Pacific Northwest rivers        | Vulnerable           |\\n| Green Sturgeon            | Olive green coloring, notochord extends into the upper lobe  | Pacific Coast                   | Near Threatened      |\\n| Lake Sturgeon             | Smooth, shark-like body, long snout                          | Great Lakes, Mississippi Basin  | Decision pending (2024)|\\n| Atlantic Sturgeon         | Five rows of scutes, upturned snout                          | Atlantic Coast                  | Endangered           |\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe sturgeon species in North America represent a critical part of the aquatic biodiversity. They are fascinating creatures with a prehistoric lineage that dates back millions of years. Conservation efforts are crucial for the survival of these species, and understanding their biology, behavior, and habitat requirements is essential for developing effective management and recovery strategies.\\n\\n### References\\n- Earthwave Society - [Sturgeons of North America](https://www.earthwave.org/sturgeon)\\n- North American Sturgeon and Paddlefish Society - [NASPS](https://nasps-sturgeon.org/)\\n- Article on Atlantic Sturgeon - [Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10592-021-01390-x)\\n- Lake Sturgeon Endangered Species Decision - [Biological Diversity](https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/lake-sturgeon-will-get-endangered-species-decision-in-2024-2021-09-15/)\\n- General Sturgeon Information - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon)\\n\\n*Note: The conservation status in the chart is indicative and may not reflect the most current status; for precise information, consult the relevant wildlife conservation authorities.*', name='Search')]}}\n",

      "{'Paper writing team': {'messages': [HumanMessage(content='Based on the document \"north_american_sturgeon_research.txt\", the research report on North American Sturgeon is structured with detailed sections that cover various aspects of sturgeon species present in North America. Here is a breakdown of the report\\'s content:\\n\\n### Introduction\\n- The report introduces sturgeons as a family of fish known for their longevity, late maturity, and unique physical characteristics such as a heterocercal caudal fin.\\n- It highlights the presence of several sturgeon species in North America, noting their anadromous nature and freshwater habitats.\\n\\n### Sturgeon Species in North America\\n- The report lists the following species:\\n  1. Pallid Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus)\\n  2. White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)\\n  3. Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris)\\n  4. Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)\\n  5. Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus)\\n\\n### Physical Characteristics\\n- Sturgeons are described as having bony plates called scutes and a shark-like heterocercal tail.\\n\\n### Behavior and Diet\\n- The species are typically bottom-feeders, consuming insects, crustaceans, and fish. Their migratory patterns can include anadromous journeys or remaining solely in freshwater.\\n\\n### Conservation Status\\n- The report discusses threats to sturgeon species, including habitat loss, overfishing, and pollution. It also mentions upcoming conservation decisions, such as the 2024 determination on the lake sturgeon\\'s protection status.\\n\\n### Chart: North American Sturgeon Species\\n- A table is provided comparing species by characteristics, habitat, and conservation status, including the endangered status of the Pallid and Atlantic sturgeons, and the near-threatened status of the Green sturgeon. The report notes that the lake sturgeon\\'s status is pending a decision in 2024.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n- Sturgeons are emphasized as an important part of aquatic biodiversity with a need for conservation and understanding of their biology and behavior for effective management and recovery strategies.\\n\\n### References\\n- The report lists several references for further information on sturgeons, including the Earthwave Society, North American Sturgeon and Paddlefish Society, Springer, Biological Diversity, and Wikipedia.\\n\\nThe document also includes an important note stating that the conservation statuses listed in the chart may not reflect the most current status and advises consulting wildlife conservation authorities for the latest information.\\n\\nThis comprehensive report serves as a valuable resource for understanding the current situation of sturgeon species in North America and the importance of ongoing conservation efforts. It is a solid foundation for further research and discussion in the scientific community and among conservation policymakers.', name='Note Taker')]}}\n",
